## üìö About the Aerofit
> Walmart is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of 
super centres, discount departmental stores, and grocery stores from the United 
States. Walmart has more than 100 million customers worldwide. 


## üéØ Objective
> The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyse the customer purchase 
behaviour (specifically, purchase amount) against the customer‚Äôs gender and the 
various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to 
understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do 
women spend more on Black Friday than men? (Assume 50 million customers are 
male and 50 million are female). 


## üìù Action Insights:
- Analyzed **purchase patterns** of **50 million male** and **50 million female customers** to understand **gender-specific spending habits** and factors influencing purchase behavior.  
- Identified that **male customers spend more on average** than females, with unmarried customers and the **26-35 age group** being the highest spenders.  
- Highlighted top-performing categories (1, 5, 8) for prioritized **inventory management and targeted marketing**, while suggesting **streamlining low-demand categories (13, 19, 20)** to optimize resources.  
- Found **City Categories A and B** have the highest concentration of **26-35-year-olds**, while **City Category C males** outspend counterparts in other cities, driving **localized marketing strategies**.  
- Designed strategies to engage **top 10 highest spenders** with personalized offers, attract **mid-term residents** (35% of total purchases), and incentivize **high-spending occupations** through financial benefits.  
- Recommended enhancing promotions for the **most common purchase range (‚Çπ5k-‚Çπ10k)** and ensuring **consistent quality** for best-selling products to sustain demand and customer loyalty.
